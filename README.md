### Roadmap for learning database internals

#### There are three categories which this repository will try to cover
1. RDBMS like Postgres
2. NoSQL like MongoDB
3. Cache like Redis

```Note: Will pick up RDBMS, and then Redis on priority for deep dive. Can skim through important topics for MongoDB initially.```

#### Books/Courses
* Postgres Locks and Query: https://pglocks.org/
